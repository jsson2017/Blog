# Blog Project
The purpose of this project is to practice different android skills including:
1. Using Jetpack Compose to build the app's UI elements
2. Implementing data persistence
3. Handling image upload

I do this by mimicking Tumblr's blog format.

## Current Progress - May 27th, 2024

This video showcases the current progress. The user can interact with the the timeline of posts by scrolling up and down, navigate to their profile page to view their blog details, and attempt to make a new post.
The following has been implemented:
1. The basic UI for the home screen (a timeline of posts), the profile screen, and a screen for making a new post.
2. The bottom navigation bar allows the user to switch between the three different screens.
3. The user can make a post with a singular text component (this is not visible in the video).

## Short-term Goals
1. Have the timeline show posts made by the current user (ultimately, replace with posts made by users the current user follows).
2. Have the list of posts in the user's profile show posts made by the current user.
3. Allow the user to make a post with an image from their camera roll.
4. Allow the user to make a post with multiple components (text and image).
5. Allow the user to "like" a post (create a database that tracks the relationship between users and posts).
6. Show an accurate "note count", which keeps track of how many "likes" a post has.
